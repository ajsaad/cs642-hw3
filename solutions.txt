# Part A:

## Recovered password
  The recovered password is 307049632

## Pseudocode for attack
  Essentially we have a string called challengeHash that is the hashed "user,password,salt" string. Then, since we are
  given the hint that the password only contains numbers we created a basic for loop using the variable 'i' from
  0 to some large max value. In each iteration of the loop we concatenate "user,i,salt" (where user and salt have
  been given), hash it with SHA-256, then compare this new hashed value to our challengeHash value. This repeats until
  the new hashed value matches the challengeHash, at which point we know that the value of 'i' at that iteration
  is the password.
  
  It would look something like this:
    
    challengeHash = "given hash using given username and salt"
    for i in range(0, infinity):
      string = "ace,+str(i)+"8593018378"
      tempHash = hashlib.sha256(string).hexdigest()
      
      if tempHash == challengeHash
        return i

## Worst case running time
  The worst case running time for this algorithm is O(N) because you will execute the loop N times (equal to the value
  of i).

## Discussion of current proposal and suggestions for improvement
  The simplest way to improve this password hasing mechanism would simply be to add other characters (letters and
  symbols) in addition to using numbers in order to make brute forcing the password more difficult.
  
  Another possible way to make this intractable would be to use a Password-Based Key Derivation Function, which would
  essentially run our hashing function thousands of times.
  
  Both of these approaches would make brute forcing the password far more diffcult because a significantly large
  magnitude of work would need to be carried out.

# Part B:

## Discussion of the current scheme
  The current encryption scheme is symmetric encryption that opens up the keyfile to get the key used for encryption.
  It uses the cipher block chaing AES method with a 16 initialization vector which is also added onto the front of the
  ciphertext. A tag is then created from the underlying message to be used as authentication in the decryption.
  
  The decryption then simply breaks up the cipher text into the components of IV, text, and tag. It is decrypted by removing
  the tag from the end of the ciphertext. Once the plain text is available it is immediately hashed to compare to the tag to check
  that the message hasn't been tampered with.
    

## Suggestions for improving the scheme
  Add an additional hash to the tag in order to make it more difficult to authenticate, knowing the cipher and the message is enough
  information to be able to alter the intialization vector accurately to a point where you can change the plaintext without needing
  the key. Making it harder to authenticate the tag would result in more work being required to alter the cipher text.
